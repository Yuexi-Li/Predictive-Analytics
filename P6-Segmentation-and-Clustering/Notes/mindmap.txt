# Hierachical clustering 
## Core
- determining the closest distances between entities
## Method 
- Botton up 

- Top down 

## Traits
- Pro: easy to explain 
- Cons: slow with larger set of objects 

# Num of Clusters 
- dendrogram cutoff 
# K-means 
## Core
- finding the objects that are closest to the centroid
## Traits
### Pro: more efficient solution  
### Cons: 
- works not well on cllusters hav unusual shapes 
- highly sensitive to outliers (scaling the data)

## Validation 

### Internal 
#### Using data to create clusters to calculate an index 
#### Check: 
- Intra-cluster : compactness 
- Inter-cluster : distinctness 
#### Method 
##### Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) -> cluster stability (compactness)
##### *Calinski-Harabasz Index (CH)
   - compactness and distinctness 
##### Select 
- higher median and compact spread 
### External 
- Using data outside to create the clusters
