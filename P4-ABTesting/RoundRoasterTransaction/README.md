Complete each section. When you are ready, save your file as a PDF document and submit it here.
Step 1: Plan Your Analysis
To perform the correct analysis, you will need to prepare a data set. (500 word limit)
Answer the following questions to help you plan out your analysis:
1.	What is the performance metric you’ll use to evaluate the results of your test?
2.	What is the test period?
3.	At what level (day, week, month, etc.) should the data be aggregated?
Step 2: Clean Up Your Data 
In this step, you should prepare the data for steps 3 and 4. You should aggregate the transaction data to the appropriate level and filter on the appropriate data ranges. You can assume that there is no missing, incomplete, duplicate, or dirty data. You’re ready to move on to the next step when you have weekly transaction data for all stores.
Step 3: Match Treatment and Control Units
In this step, you should create the trend and seasonality variables, and use them along with you other control variable(s) to match two control units to each treatment unit. Note: Calculate the number of transactions per store per week to calculate trend and seasonality.

Apart from trend and seasonality... 
1.	What control variables should be considered? Note: Only consider variables in the RoundRoastersStore file.
2.	What is the correlation between your each potential control variable and your performance metric?
3.	What control variables will you use to match treatment and control stores?
4.	Please fill out the table below with your treatment and control stores pairs:

Treatment Store	Control Store 1	Control Store 2
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		

Step 4: Analysis and Writeup
Conduct your A/B analysis and create a short report outlining your results and recommendations. (250 words limit)

Answer these questions. Be sure to include visualizations from your analysis:

1.	What is your recommendation - Should the company roll out the updated menu to all stores? 
2.	What is the lift from the new menu for West and Central regions (include statistical significance)? 
3.	What is the lift from the new menu overall?
