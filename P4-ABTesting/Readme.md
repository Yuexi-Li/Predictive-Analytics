- Control group: The set of units in an experiment that will receive a standard, unmodified experience, providing a baseline comparison for the treatment group.

- Control variables: Variables that are the most influential on the outcome of the target variable, used to make sure that treatment and control units are as similar as possible.

- Duration: How long an experiment will run for.

- Lift: Difference in observations from treatment to control group.

Linear regression: A method of modeling the relationship between a target variable and one or more control variables using a linear equation.

Population: The set of units to be used in an experiment.

P-value: The likelihood that the actual difference in mean values between the treatment and control groups is 0. The closer the P-value is to 0, the higher the likelihood that an actual difference in means has been observed. A P-value of 0.05 or below (indicating 95% likelihood of difference in means) is considered statistically significant.

Randomized design: An experimental setup in which units are assigned at random to either the treatment or control group. Used in scenarios with minimal opportunity to control variables, or in scenarios with a large enough volume and velocity of data to not be worried about bias.

Sample size: The number of units needed in an experiment to make statistically significant inferences about a larger population.

Target variable: What is being measured during an experiment.

Test of means: Statistical calculation of whether the mean values of the treatment and control groups are the same or different.

Treatment: The change made during an experiment, which will be given to units in the treatment group.

Treatment group: The set of units in an experiment that will receive a modified or manipulated experience, relative to the control group.

Treatment variable: The variable being changed to observe its effect on the target variable. Also called the experimental or independent variable.

T-test: A type of test used to determine if the results of an experiment are statistically significant or not, resulting in a P-value.

Unit of diversion: How units are assigned to either the treatment or control group.
