## Time series Decomposition plot 
### Trend (A/M/N)
###  Sesonality (A/M/N)
### Error (A/M) 

## Determine pattern 
### Constant (N)
### Linear - (A)
### Exponential -(M)

## Build Model 
### Internal: in sample error measure 
- RMSE and MASE
### External : accuracy 
- holdout vs. forecasting
## Choose Model 
### AIC
# ARIMA 
## Non-Seasonal ARIMA (p,d,q) 
### Stationalizing -> `d` 
#### take differencing perform (I) till mean ~ 0 
#### Evalute: ACF 
###  Auto-regression  `p`
#### ACF: lag_1 autocorrelation
- Positive  -> AR 
- negative  -> MA 
#### PACF: dropped 
- gradually -> MA model 
- at $lag_k$ -> AR(k)
### Moving Average`q` 
- can smooth sudden movements of data 
#### situation 
- ACF: negatively autocorrelated at $lag_1$
- ACF: sharply cut off after few lags 
- PACF decreases graduly 

## Seasonal ARIMA (p,d,q)(P,D,Q)m 
### Stationalizing (same as ARIMA)
### AR
- better when seasonal autocorrelation is positive 
- ACF slow decay + PACF cut off to 0  
### MA
- better when seasonal autocorrelation is negative  
- ACF cut off toward 0 + PACF decay 
# Plots 
## ACF
### AC
- the degree of time series is correlated with own past values 
### Definition:
- correlation of a time series with itself, lagged by X time units 
### Usage
#### check for stationary 
- is not slow decay toward 0 and is not signficant correlation 
#### determine 
##### AR: positive AC at $lag_1$
##### MA: negative AC at $lag_1$
## PACF 
### PAC
- correlation between two varibles controlling for the values of another set of variables 
### Usage: set the number 
#### dropped at $lag_k$ -> AR(k) 
#### gradually -> MA
